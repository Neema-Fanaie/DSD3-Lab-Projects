# Digital Systems Design 3 Lab

## Overview
This repository contains my work from a semester-long **Digital Systems Design Lab**, where I learned and applied **Verilog HDL** to design, simulate, and verify digital circuits. The lab focused on building a strong foundation in digital logic design and hardware description languages, progressing from basic combinational circuits to more complex sequential systems.

## Topics Covered
Throughout the semester, the following concepts were explored:

- Introduction to Verilog HDL  
- Combinational logic design  
  - Logic gates  
  - Multiplexers
- Sequential logic design  
  - Latches and flip-flops  
  - Registers  
  - Counters
- Desiging for VGA Displays
- Finite State Machines (FSMs)  
- Clocking, reset strategies, and timing concepts  
- Testbenches and simulation  
- Functional verification using waveform analysis  

## Tools & Technologies
- **Language:** Verilog HDL  
- **Simulation Tools:** Vivado
- **Target Platform:** Basys3 Artix-7 FPGA Board

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of this lab, I was able to:

- Write synthesizable Verilog code  
- Design and debug digital circuits  
- Create testbenches for functional verification  
- Understand timing behavior and hardware constraints  
- Translate theoretical digital logic concepts into working hardware designs
